## **Description** :     

The business landscape is poised for continuous growth, with a particular focus on consumer spending in wholesale purchases, which serves as a pivotal indicator for companies when identifying their market. However, the challenge lies in segmenting the market with limited information. Therefore, RFM analysis is conducted to facilitate clustering, streamlining the process of comprehending customer profiles in detail and achieving favorable business outcomes.

## **Objective**:    

From the above background we have a plan to do:    
- Making a RFM Method to ease understanding for segmentation    
- Create clusters to find out buyer segmentation    
- Create a recommendation system    

## **Creation Model**: 

- Using RFM method
- Using Kmeans Clustering calculation    
- Using Recommendation System
